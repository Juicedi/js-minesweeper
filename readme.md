# Minesweeper

I began making this project just to test out some newish javascript developer
environment stuff like webpack. Also I will be testing how to handle large
number of elements on a web-page.

## How to install and run

You will need Node.js and NPM.

When you have those installed, try running ```npm install```.

After installing npm packages, you should be able to start webpack-dev-server
by calling ```npm run start:dev```

To build the package, call ```npm run build```
